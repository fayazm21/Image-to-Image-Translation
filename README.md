# Image-to-Image-Translation

## Overview
This project explores four advanced GAN architectures - CycleGAN, Pix2Pix-GAN, Wasserstein GAN, and Deep Convolutional GAN - for image-to-image translation. It extends to text-driven image translation, leveraging these GANs to transform textual descriptions into images.
